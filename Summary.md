# Summary of What We’ve Covered

---

## 1. **Simple Linear Regression**
- **Goal**: Predict a continuous target variable (`y`) based on a single input feature (`X`).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Model**: `y = mx + b` (where `m` is the slope and `b` is the intercept).
  - **Training**: Use the `LinearRegression` class from `scikit-learn` to fit the model.
  - **Evaluation**: Visualize the regression line and calculate the slope and intercept.
- **Example**: Predicted house prices based on a single feature (e.g., number of rooms).

---

## 2. **Multiple Linear Regression**
- **Goal**: Predict a continuous target variable (`y`) based on **multiple input features** (`X1, X2, ..., Xn`).
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Model**: `y = b0 + b1X1 + b2X2 + ... + bnXn`.
  - **Training**: Fit the model using multiple features.
  - **Evaluation**: Visualize the relationship between each feature and the target variable.
- **Example**: Predicted house prices based on multiple features (e.g., number of rooms, crime rate).
